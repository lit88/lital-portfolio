        <p>
          I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel and now live in Carrboro, North Carolina with my spouse and 3 years old son.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my professional path as a pharmacist, I have a PharmD degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I worked as a pharmacist and a clinical pharmacist since 2013 in Israel. I worked both in hospitals and with outpatients, I have had interfaces with both patients and doctors.</p>
        <p>
          Since arriving in the USA in 2020, following my husband's post-doctoral career, I have been looking for a new career path for myself and I believe I have finally found it in software engineering.</p>
        <p>
          Though I'm new in the software world, I have a lot of experience working in diverse environments and collaborating with co-workers from different professions.</p>
        <p>
          I know I can bring passion and spirit to your project and can't wait to start working!</p>
